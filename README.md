## Upgrades
- Made the logos svgs 
- Made the social icons svgs (they weren't provided)
- Made the hero image a responsive background iamge with multiple sizes
- Added hover effects to video, buttons, and social icons in footer

## Notes
- The buttons in the footer don't stack so they match the button group in the header on mobile
- Ideally the webfont would be downloaded and served locally
- The html could be minified to make the size smaller
- If there was more than one page some of the components would be coded differently to allow for use on multiple sections.
- This was only tested in modern browsers and on an iPhone 8 due to time.
